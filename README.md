# Road_Accident_Tableau Project

This project analyses road accidents for a period. The data was collected in Excel. 

The project involved cleaning and manipulating the data, followed by visualizing it using Tableau.
The first step of the project involved performing minor data cleaning in Excel, ensuring that the data was accurate and complete. From there, I used Tableau to further clean and manipulate the data, preparing it for visualization.

The report showcases the number of casualties and accidents by month, week, and possible causes of accidents and their severity. By visualizing this data, I was able to gain insights into the patterns and trends of road accidents, highlighting areas of concern and potential solutions.

One of the key highlights of this project was identifying the possible causes of accidents and their severity. By leveraging Tableau's visualization capabilities, I was able to showcase the relationship between different factors such as weather conditions, road type, and time of day, and their impact on accident severity.

The insights from this dashboard can be used by a wide range of stakeholders, including policymakers, city planners, law enforcement agencies, transportation companies, and individuals like you and me to better plan our travel journeys based on weather and road conditions. By understanding the causes and patterns of road accidents, these stakeholders can develop targeted interventions to improve road safety, reduce casualties, and enhance transportation infrastructure.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using Excel and Tableau. It showcases my ability to extract insights from complex datasets and present them in a clear and concise manner.
